        <p class="clearfix">With the goal of designing methods/tools to improve programmers’ effectiveness, we followed the
        contextual design process to develop a deeper understanding of the programming process and how information flows among
        programmers and the systems they use.</p>

        <h2 class="section_heading">Observation &amp; Interpretation</h2>
        <p>We began by observing students completing programming assignments for a computer systems course at Carnegie Mellon
        University. Each of our observations (5 total) lasted for approximately one hour.</p>
        <p>Next, my 4 teammates and I participated in several interpretation sessions. During these sessions, each observer
        recounted the events that transpired during his/her observation session while other team members repackaged key information
        into notes containing insights, sequence models, and flow models.</p>

        <p>Affinity diagrams offer an effective way to organize data and ideas. This step of the process allowed us to more easily
        visualize the essence of the data and uncover persistent issues.</p>

        <h2 class="section_heading">Sequence Consolidation</h2>
        <p>The goal of sequence consolidation is to create a set of procedures that describe all of the collected sequences. This
        step allowed us to obtain a more complete picture of the users’ intents and the processes that they employ during task
        performance.</p>

        <h2 class="section_heading">Flow Consolidation</h2>
        <p>To create a single, consolidated flow model we began by merging all of the objects with the same title. For each new
        object, we then added all of the responsibilities and communication paths from all its representatives in the original
        models. Finally, we revised the new model to reduce synonymous items (objects, responsibilities, or communication
        flows).</p>

        <h2 class="section_heading">Visioning</h2>
        <p>This final step involved (1) brainstorming design ideas grounded in data, and (2) telling a story about how the users’
        work will change when a new system is introduced.</p>
        <p>To effectively illustrate how our three candidate solutions might address the problems identified, we created a series
        of storyboards.</p>

        <h4 class="center-text">V1: TA Queuing System</h4>
        <img class="img-responsive img-center"
        src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/images/projects/ucre/vision_1.png') }}" height="auto"
        width="100%" alt="Storyboard of Vision 1" />
        <p>The consolidated sequence model revealed the existence of long periods where students wait for TA feedback. Furthermore,
        any knowledge generated from student-TA interactions is lost after the session. We propose a system that not only helps
        students queue for TAs, but stores the information obtained from the help session in an interactive FAQ document.</p>

        src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/images/projects/ucre/vision_2.png') }}" height="auto"
        width="100%" alt="Storyboard of Vision 2" />
        <p>Our affinity diagram communicates that students want to access past versions of their code, share it with TAs, and
        understand how past code submissions were evaluated by AutoLab. To address these user needs, we propose a system that
        creates repositories for each assignment. Students receive starter code when they check out the repository. Once code
        changes are committed, they automatically receive feedback from Autolab (which is then stored and indexed).</p>

        <h4 class="center-text">V3: Integrated Development Environment</h4>
        <img class="img-responsive img-center"
        src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/images/projects/ucre/vision_3.png') }}" height="auto"
        width="100%" alt="Storyboard of Vision 3" />
        <p>Our consolidated flow model revealed distant links between the code editing software students use and important
        reference materials (e.g. external resources, style guidelines, assignment details, etc.). We therefore propose an
        integrated development environment that helps users identify errors, find useful resources, and submit questions to peers.
        Notably, this application would reduce the amount of switching between different windows that all contain information
        needed to perform the programming task.</p>
