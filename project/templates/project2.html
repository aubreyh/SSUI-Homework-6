          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p class="clearfix">The diagnostic interpretation of medical images is a highly specialized task typically performed by
          individuals who have developed expertise in radiology. During the analysis phase, diagnosticians scan the anatomical
          structures depicted on film while simultaneously classifying image features as either normal or aberrant. The complexity
          of this binary decision process may be further complicated by several factors, including (1) abnormalities which appear
          minute, inconspicuous, and/or ambiguous, (2) the resemblance that exists among certain disease processes, and (3) the
          celerity with which this categorization is normally performed. Finally, findings must be integrated upon completion of
          the analytical stage for the purpose of recommending future action.</p>

          <strong>Participants:</strong> 2 residents, 1 physician assistant (all non-radiology specialists)</p>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>Participants’ abnormality detection accuracy on five cases with 16 prominent findings ranged from 18-38%, while their
          diagnostic accuracy ranged from 60-80%.</p>
          <p>This result suggests notable difficulty detecting abnormalities and integrating findings to form a diagnosis. Further,
          each subject demonstrated an overreliance on patient symptomatology.</p>

          <strong>Case 1</strong> (mild congestive heart failure):

          <p>Each subject’s diagnostic accuracy was 100%.</p>
          <p>The results suggest that case interpretation was facilitated either by (1) the tutor’s scaffolding of the task, or (2)

            <li>
              <p>“Diagnosis” combo box set as visible upon completion of prior steps to more successfully capture users’ attention

          <p>The cognitive tutor was developed using the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT), which include an interface toolkit
          with a number of components that have a predefined look and feel. It requires users to systematically assess all regions
          of the chest for aberrations. If features indicative of disease are present, the tutor requests that users select
          explanations for the abnormalities. The tutor restricts users from selecting a diagnosis until all enumerated regions
          have been assigned a normal/abnormal classification.</p>
